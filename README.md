# Project Description

A way for people to gather, collect and stay in contact with people that you meet.

To make the social and connecting effortless, seamless and fun to do. To give courage and ability to less outgoing people to connect and network more comfortably. To unify the social and personal networking aspect of everyday events. Events meaning any time, place, & circumstance.

## Key Features

- Give users the ability to connect with each other through the app.
- Get and Store contacts in a fast and simple way.
- Make it easy to see where you met each contact. A map is displayed with geo-location tracking of where you swaaped. 
- Have the ability to add an 'event' to each contact. Event meaning any circumstance with a time and place. This helps you remember the context of where/when/why/how you connected. Ex: 'Office Luncheon,' 'Couples Retreat,' 'Networking Event' ect. 
- Have the ability to add notes about a contact to make it easy to remember why you connected in the first place.

## Tech Stack

Front end deployed to `Netlify` and built using:

- [React](https://www.apollographql.com/): ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces specifically for single page applications. It's used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/): Auth0 provides authentication and authorization as a service. We are here to give developers and companies the building blocks they need to secure their applications without having to become security experts.
- [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router): The structure of Reach Router is really simple. Routers select a child to render based on the child's path. You as the developer simply specify your desired slug (a slug is the part of a URL which identifies a page using human-readable keywords).
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/): The Apollo platform is an implementation of GraphQL that can transfer data between the cloud (server) to the UI of your app. In fact, Apollo builds its environment in such a way that we can use it to handle GraphQL on the client as well as the server side of the application.
- [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/): Tailwind is a collection of low-level utility classes. They can be used like lego bricks to build any kind of component. The collection covers the most important CSS properties, but it can be easily extended in a variety of ways. With Tailwind, customization isn’t pain in the neck anymore. The framework has great documentation, covering every class utility in detail and showing the ways it can be customized. All modern browsers, and IE11+, are supported.

## Extensions

Please install these VS Code extensions in order to run the application: 

**❗️Important: Requires VS Code 1.36 or newer**

- JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly

# Available Scripts 

in the project directory, you can run: 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. 
open http://localhost:3000 to view in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches test runner, and runs tests. 6/7 failing

### `npx cypress open'

Launches the Cypress testing gui to run cypress tests. 

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm eject`

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# APIs

## Auth0 authentication API 

[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) provides authentication and authorization as a service.

You can connect any application (written in any language or on any stack) to Auth0 and define the identity providers you want to use (how you want your users to log in).

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, you must set up your own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

#### Variables:

- REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN - Domain at which the application is set accordingly with Auth0, for proper authentication.
- REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID - Unique ID provided by Auth0 to be used with the applicaiton.
- REACT_APP_APOLLO_URI - The location at which the application's backend server is located.
- REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_NAME - The name of the cloud, being used on Cloudinary.
- REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_PRESET - The preset of the cloud, being used on Cloudinary.
   
# Testing

## Cypress

We use [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end to end tests on the frontend.

Writing end-to-end tests takes a lot of different tools to work together. With Cypress you get multiple tools in one.

Cypress provides in browser end to end testing and works with any framework all in the browser.
